# Validators Package

This package contains predicate classes that validate whether matrices are in specific forms.

## Overview

The `validators` package provides validation functionality to check if matrices conform to specific mathematical forms required for various algorithms.

## Key Classes

- **`TrappeformPredicate.java`**: Validates whether a matrix is in row echelon form (trappeform)
- **`RedusertTrappeformPredicate.java`**: Validates whether a matrix is in reduced row echelon form (reduced trappeform)

## Usage

These validators are used to ensure matrices are in the correct form before performing certain operations, particularly during and after Gaussian elimination processes.
