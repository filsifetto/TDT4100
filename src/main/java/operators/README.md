# Operators Package

This package contains supporting operator classes that provide specialized operations for matrices and vectors.

## Overview

The `operators` package provides utility classes that implement specific mathematical operations and algorithms used throughout the project.

## Key Classes

- **`VektorOperator.java`**: Vector-specific operations and utilities
- **`RealMatrixOperator.java`**: Matrix-specific operations for real matrices
- **`RealToolMatrix.java`**: Tool matrix utilities for matrix operations
- **`PivotComperator.java`**: Comparator for finding pivot elements during Gaussian elimination

## Usage

These classes are used as supporting utilities by calculation classes and other parts of the system to perform specialized operations that don't belong in the core fundamental classes.
