# Calculations Package

This package provides high-level calculation wrappers that combine fundamental operations to solve common linear algebra problems.

## Overview

The `kalkulasjoner` package contains classes that wrap together multiple fundamental operations to perform complete calculations.

## Key Classes

- **`InverseMatrixCalculator.java`**: Calculates the inverse of a matrix using Gaussian elimination
- **`EquationSolver.java`**: Solves systems of linear equations
- **`ProjectionCalculator.java`**: Computes the projection of a vector onto a given vector space

## Usage

These classes serve as the main API for performing complex linear algebra calculations. They internally use classes from the `fundament`, `gausseliminasjon`, and `operators` packages to complete their operations.
